Tutorial to get started with HTTP APIs using Ktor

>In this tutorial, we're going to create an HTTP API that can serve as a backend for any application, be it mobile, web, desktop, or even a B2B service. 
We will see how routes are defined and structured, how serialization plugins help simplify tedious tasks, and how we can test parts of our application 
both manually and automated.

>Throughout the tutorial, we'll build a simple JSON API that allows us to query information about the customers of our fictitious business, 
as well as the orders we currently want to fulfill. We will build a convenient way of listing all customers and orders in our system, get 
information for individual customers and orders, and provide the functionality to add new entries and remove old entries.
